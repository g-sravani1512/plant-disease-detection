# 🌿 Plant Disease Detection System

An AI-powered **Plant Disease Detection Web Application** built using **Flask, TensorFlow, and Deep Learning**.
The system analyzes plant leaf images and predicts plant diseases using trained **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)** and **InceptionV3 Transfer Learning models**.

This application helps farmers and researchers **detect plant diseases early** and take preventive measures to reduce crop loss.

# 📊 Dataset

The model was trained using the **PlantVillage Dataset**, which contains thousands of labeled plant leaf images.

Dataset Source (Kaggle):

```id="2ns2db"
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease
```

Dataset includes:

* Healthy plant leaves
* Diseased plant leaves
* Multiple crop types
* Multiple disease categories

# 🛠 Technologies Used

* Python
* Flask
* TensorFlow / Keras
* NumPy
* Pillow
* ReportLab
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

# ⚙️ Installation

## 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```id="uay1vo"
git clone https://github.com/g-sravani1512/plant-disease-detection.git
```

```id="17ctzo"
cd plant-disease-detection
```

---

## 2️⃣ Create Virtual Environment

```id="fkk1u2"
python -m venv venv
```

Activate environment

Windows:

```id="2excf6"
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Mac/Linux:

```id="pxix89"
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

## 3️⃣ Install Dependencies

```id="u3jn33"
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

# ▶️ Run the Application

Start the Flask server:

```id="6l9bri"
python main.py
```

The application will run at:

```id="5g6bl1"
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

---

## 🔄 Automatic Model Download

When the application starts, it automatically checks whether the trained model is available locally.

If the model is not found, the system performs the following steps:

1. Checks whether the model file exists in the `models/` directory.
2. If the model is missing, it automatically downloads the model from **Google Drive**.
3. The downloaded model is stored inside the `models/` folder.
4. **TensorFlow** then loads the model and the application becomes ready to perform predictions.

This approach keeps the GitHub repository **lightweight** and avoids GitHub's file size limitations while still allowing the application to run normally.


---

# 📄 PDF Report Generation

After prediction, the application generates a **disease analysis report** containing:

* Disease Name
* Prediction Confidence
* Disease Description
* Symptoms
* Remedies

Users can download the report as a **PDF file**.
